# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This project required an exploratory analysis of rideshare data in order to help improve access to rideshare services, as well as assess adisparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types. I created visualizations using the data provided in order to better convey the findings of the analysis.


### Resources
Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplot.


## Results
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides a comparison of the ridesharing services in the 3 types of cities included in this project: rural, surburban, and urban cities. Upon close examination, clear evidence was found for a much larger demand for PyBer in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities combined.

Over the span of 4 months, from January 2019 up until May 2019, data shows that 1,625 rides were recorded in urban cities, 625 in suburban cities, and 125 in rural cities. This means that 68.4% of the total PyBer rides took place in urban cities, 26.3% of rides were in suburban cities, and only 5.3% of rides were in rural cities. The piechart below illustrates these results.

Considering this finding, we can expect to see similar trends when inspecting other metrics and criteria for the PyBer rideshare data. When looking at the number of PyBer drivers in each city type, we can, indeed, see a similar pattern, as shown in the figure below. Data shows that there were 2,405 (81%) drivers in urban cities, 490 (16%) drivers in suburban cities, and only 78 (3%) drivers in rural cities.

Consequently, the fare shares follow a similar pattern, where urban rides accumulated a total of $39,854.38 in fares, suburban rides a total of $19,356.33, and rural rides a total of $4,327.93. As illustrated in the figure below, this means that out of the total fares for PyBer, 62.7% were from urban cities, 30.5% were from suburban cities, while the rest of 6.8% were from rural cities.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.



## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
