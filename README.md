# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This project required an exploratory analysis of rideshare data in order to help improve access to rideshare services, as well as assess adisparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types. I created visualizations using the data provided in order to better convey the findings of the analysis.


### Resources
Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplot.


## Results
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides a comparison of the ridesharing services in the 3 types of cities included in this project: rural, surburban, and urban cities. Upon close examination, clear evidence was found for a much larger demand for PyBer in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities combined.

Over the span of 4 months, from January 2019 up until May 2019, data shows that 1,625 rides were recorded in urban cities, 625 in suburban cities, and 125 in rural cities. This means that 68.4% of the total PyBer rides took place in urban cities, 26.3% of rides were in suburban cities, and only 5.3% of rides were in rural cities. The piechart below illustrates these results.

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.



## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
